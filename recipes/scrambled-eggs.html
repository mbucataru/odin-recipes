            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack 2-3 eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and pepper, and whisk until the yolks and whites are fully combined</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a pat of butter, allowing it to melt and coat the pan</li>
            <li>Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet and let them cook undisturbed for a few seconds until they start to set around the edges</li>
            <li>Gently stir the eggs with a spatula, pushing them from the edges towards the center. Lift the cooked portions and allow the uncooked eggs to flow underneath</li>
            <li>Continue this process until the eggs are mostly cooked but still slightly runny. Remove from heat and allow the residual heat to finish cooking the eggs.</li>
            <li>Serve on a plate and enjoy!</li>
